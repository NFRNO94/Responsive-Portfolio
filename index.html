        <p id="bodytext">My name is Dante Proto. I was born December 6th, 1994 in Mesa, AZ. I currently
            live in Queen Creek, AZ, where I grew up. In my younger years, I attended St. Timothy's Catholic Academy
            1st through 6th grade. I went to a public school for the first time in the 7th grade at Payne Jr. High. It
            was around this time when I started playing my favorite sport, American Football. After football season, I
            became
            a wrestler following in my father's footsteps. My Jr. High sports career prepared me for High School level
            competition.
            I had a very successful Freshman football season. I moved up to the Junior Varsity level, which ended up
            being where my
            football career ended due to illness, and injury. I did wrestle all 4 years of high school, although I was
            injury prone
            my first 3 years in highschool. I was contending with Mono as well, which also ruined my Junior Varsity
            football
            career. I did have a very good varsity comeback my senior year, and barely missed my chance at going to the
            state
            wrestling tournament(by 3 points). After highschool, I wanted to be a mechanical engineer due to inspiration
            from my neighbor. I quickly realized that
            calculus was a big part of engineering, and it was my least favorite class in college. I switced my major to
            General
            Business after my first year of college. I have been working towards becoming an accountant. I have not
            obtained a degree
            in business yet. However, I did study part time for 3 years while working fast food at Panda Express, and
            later working
            retail at Costco. I was unable to promote to a full time position at Costco, however, I did realize I
            enjoyed learning
            about new technology. I was a sales representative in the electronics section before I left
            Costco to drive Uber and Lyft full time. It was fun for awhile, however, the hours are hard, and the wear
            and tear on
            your vehicle really adds up over time. I landed a job with Dish Network as a Customer Service
            representative. I handled
            customer service calls until I was later promoted to technical support. I then handled a mix of tech and
            customer service
            calls. As delightful as phone calls may be, I decided that they were not for me, and I was thinking about
            quitting Dish before
            Chat Support came to our site. I was a part of the first 2 chat teams that were created at the Phoenix
            location. I now
            handle a mix of tech and customer service chats, up to two at a time. I enjoy chat support a lot more than
            phone calls,
            as it seems to be more efficient, and I can be more descriptive to help the customer to the best of my
            ability.
            The only issue with chat is there is not a lot of room to grow, and promote. That is why I am currently
            attending UA Coding
            Bootcamp, to learn about writing code, and using code in real life applications. I also would love to
            advance
            to a point where I can make websites, and applications of my own. I hope to find a new career with Dish,
            or a better opportunity with my new coding knowledge, pending the completion of the Bootcamp. I am excited
            and eager to
            learn as much as I can about code!
